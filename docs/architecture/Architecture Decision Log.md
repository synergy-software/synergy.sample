# Decisions log

Below are the decisions made throughout the course of the project, 
along with those that need to be made (or discarded) in the future.<br/>
The decision-making process is not linear, so the list is organized in a way that can be read from top to bottom.<br/>
While not all of these decisions are strictly related to architecture,
they are included here to provide a comprehensive view of the entire production process.

## Contribution

Anyone can create a Pull Request (PR) to propose changes to an existing ADR or introduce a new one.<br/>
The PR will then be discussed and reviewed by the team and, if approved, merged into the `main` branch.<br/>
If you have valuable insights that could be captured as an Architecture Decision Record (ADR),
don't hesitate to share them with us.
