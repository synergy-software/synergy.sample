# Synergy Modern Software Architecture Sample

Sample project to demonstrate modern architecture approach

## Architecture

To familiarize yourself with the architectural concepts of this sample project, 
check out the:
* [Architecture Decision Log](docs/architecture/Architecture%20Decision%20Log.md)
* [Architecture Model](docs/architecture/Architecture%20Model.md)

## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

When you are ready to start working on the project, read the [Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)](docs/process/Development%20Process.md) document first.

## Keywords

This section provides an overview of key terms and keywords commonly used in the project.
Understanding these concepts is crucial for effective communication among team members and stakeholders,
as well as for adhering to best practices in software engineering. 
The chapter outlines essential terminology across various domains, 
including software architecture, coding practices, project management, and development methodologies.
